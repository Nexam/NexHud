MaterialsSearchs.json work the exact same way as Searchs.json

Except for one thing: the name of the search is a Materials.
This searchs will be use in the "improve" panel to launch a quick search to
find the system/body with the best chance of dropping the material you need.

You can edit theses searchs if you want :)


Note: Raw materials search are automatically created. You can write a searchs in MaterialsSearchs.json with
the name of the raw material to override this.
